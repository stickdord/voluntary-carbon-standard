# Voluntary Carbon Standard for China

This repository serves as a collaborative platform for developing a draft voluntary carbon market standard for China. The goal is to create a robust, transparent, and environmentally sound framework that encourages high-quality emission reduction projects, particularly in sectors not yet covered by the national Emissions Trading System (ETS).

## Core Principles

- **Transparency:** All documentation, discussions, and decisions will be openly accessible to foster trust and stakeholder engagement.
- **Environmental Integrity:** The standard will prioritize real, measurable, and permanent emission reductions, ensuring that carbon credits represent genuine climate benefits.
- **Inclusivity:** We welcome contributions from government agencies, industry experts, academic institutions, and civil society to ensure a balanced and practical standard.
- **Practicality:** The standard should be implementable and scalable, supporting China's dual carbon goals (carbon peaking and carbon neutrality).
